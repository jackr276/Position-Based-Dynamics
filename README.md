# Position Based Dynamics

## Authors: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276) and [Randall Tarazona](https://github.com/Randall543)

This project is an implementation and exploration of the Position-Based Dynamics approach to simulating dynamic objects in computer graphics. The mathematics and overall design of these programs are based off of this 2006 [paper](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf) on the subject.

There are 4 separate demonstrations, the code for each being linked below:
  1. An interactive [worm simulation](https://github.com/jackr276/Position-Based-Dynamics/blob/main/worm.py)
  2. An interactive [collision demonstration](https://github.com/jackr276/Position-Based-Dynamics/blob/main/collision.py)
  3. A demonstration of a [point constraint](https://github.com/jackr276/Position-Based-Dynamics/blob/main/point.py)
  4. A combination of our worm simulation and point constraint into a [rope simulation](https://github.com/jackr276/Position-Based-Dynamics/blob/main/rope.py)

### Configuration Instructions
  1. Download the desired *.py files and [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jackr276/Position-Based-Dynamics/blob/main/requirements.txt)
  2. Create a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
  3. Activate your new python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
  4. Run ```pip -r install requirements.txt```
  5. Run the desired file with the command ```python filename.py```
  6. Enjoy the position based dynamics!
