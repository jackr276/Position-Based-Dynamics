# Position Based Dynamics

## Authors: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276) and [Randall Tarazona](https://github.com/Randall543)

This project is an implementation and exploration of the Position-Based Dynamics Approach to simulating agents in computer graphics. The mathematics and overall structure are based off of this 2006 [paper](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf) on the subject.
